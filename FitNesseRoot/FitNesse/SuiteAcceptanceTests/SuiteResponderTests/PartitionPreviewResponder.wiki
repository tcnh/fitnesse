Suite

The partition preview responder can show how the 'Suite Responder' will split a suite in sub-suites when using the !style_code(partitionIndex) and !style_code(partitionCount) parameters.

When you execute a suite page indicating that you want to partition the suite (i.e. split it in parts) and only run one partition, !-FitNesse-! should only run that partition.

The partition preview responder shows which pages go in which partition, and how the tests will be ordered in the test system.
